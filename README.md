# Advent of Code 2024

This is my solutions to all 25 days of Advent of Code 2024.  You can use this code to test your inputs by replacing the input files located in ```/src/inputs```.


You can then run the code using the following command:

```zig
zig build run
```

You can also utilize each days solution by importing the module into your own project.
